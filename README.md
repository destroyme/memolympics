# Welcome to the Mnemolympics repository!

In a nutshell, this game is a platform to practice and learn mnemonic techniques. It does this by emulating a few (and in the future, **MANY**!) of the games played at various Memory championships (REF: http://mt.artofmemory.com/wiki/Category:Memory_Competitions). This current build is going to have 3 games that focus on memorizing words, numbers, and cards.

Learning the techniques will consist of both text and video with plenty of animation. Other features of the program consist of a login to enable tracking of the user's progress through a scoring system, and an inhouse 'system builder' which will help the user build their mnemonic systems.

This build is currently disorganized as I realized very early that I need to do an intensive focus on design of the game before beginning to code. This also entails a lot of visual and game research. A lot of the core pseudocode for the game has been built, but much of it is changing as I'm learning how to build the game, animation, and of course design/implement new features on top of the existing ones.
