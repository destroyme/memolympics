# Welcome to the Mnemolympics repository!

This game is intended to emulate some (and in the future, **MANY**!) of the games played at various Memory championships. (REF: http://mt.artofmemory.com/wiki/Category:Memory_Competitions)

This is currently an empty build as i'm focusing a lot on design of the game and doing a lot of research and creating a lot of pseudocode. Much of the organization of the content is going to be subject to change as I learn how to build the game, animation, and of course design/implement new features on top of the existing ones.

I will be logging thoughts behind everything in the wiki!
